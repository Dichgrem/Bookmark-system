# Changelog

All notable changes to subnav.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Migrate to single-user mode: remove user_id/role columns, AdminUser, multi-user APIs and frontend user management UI (keep login/JWT/change password/env-based bootstrap)
- HTML import parsing is now case-insensitive, decodes entities, and prefers ICON_URI over bulky data-URI icons

### Fixed
- Export order now follows sort_order (was insertion order)
- Router pre-checks JWT expiry to avoid wasted requests to protected pages
- Migrate remaining hardcoded Chinese UI text to i18n

### BREAKING
- Database schema changed; delete existing database files to recreate

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

### Security
- SSRF protection: reject private/loopback/link-local addresses in link checker
- Login rate limiting (5 failures → 15 min lockout)
- Replace public register with env-based admin bootstrap (`ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

### Fixed
- Infinite polling when checking links with no bookmarks
- Link checker concurrency (unified tokio mutex, task error handling, ordered results)
